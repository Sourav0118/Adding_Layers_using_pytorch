# Adding Layers using pytorch

A **layer** in a deep learning model is a structure or network topology in the model's architecture, which takes information from the previous layers and then passes it to the next layer.

This repository helps you get the understanding of the concept called layers in machine learning. 

The .ipynb notebook is self explainatory and can be easily understand by a beginer.

The concept of adding layers is been used in this repo by creating a custom model in which multiple layers are been added. 

Note: The notebook using MNIST dataset for training purpose. Before running the notebook, one must download the MNIST dataset and should change the path to the dataset.
